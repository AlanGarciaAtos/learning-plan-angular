command: la (Shows every file, event the hidden one. ex: .git)

## Branching

```css
git checkout -b feature

```

It can happen in development you need to make a feature instead of making a branch called "feature".
It's better to make specific. `feature/new-product-etc`, `feature-11-something`

## Local Development
