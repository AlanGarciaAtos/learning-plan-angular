Meta Tags

It's a tag for the website to indicate some specific keywords. To get a better positioning for the SEO.

Shows the what topics you’re showing in the webpage. They said this method show no benefit for the SEO at least for google but in the other hand bing they didn’t say anything. They disregard (since 2009) this meta tag because you can spam a ton of words like you’re using # in instagram.

```html
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP" />
```
