## ARIA ROLES

**Landmark roles:** Main header and footer. Don‚Äôt overused this tags, having multiples nav could harm your webpage.

Describing the content of the tag section.

```html
<section role="contentinfo" />
```

Identify which are the primary and seconday

```html
<nav aria-label="primary" />
```

### Document structure

You can use `role=‚Äùnav‚Äù` & `‚Äúform‚Äù`. That‚Äôs not necessary we have proper tags

**Widget:** describe interactive roles which lacks semantic ( _div_ ).

**Window:** your typical pop-ups (_dialog_ & _alertdialog_)

**Live region:** set to _assertive_, _polite_ and _off_ states. When we use JS to change the webpage without reloading the website.

This will help the people who need accessibility in the website. Using aria-labels correctly facilitates the navigation.

Semantic describes its meaning to both the browser and developer.

1. Describes the version of the HTML, this one is HTML5
2. Determines the language of our website. (es = spanish, en = english)
3. Accepts certain characters like accents, √± and even emotes üëÅüëÑüëÅ
4. Tells the browser to use the latest version of IE
5. Tells the browser to always make the website the size of the device (make it ‚Äúresponsive‚Äù)
6. Help the SEO and when they find the website it will observe the description
7. Robots the help us to follow my index and to be visible

```html
1 <!DOCTYPE html> 2
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    3
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    4
