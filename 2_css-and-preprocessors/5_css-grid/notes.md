# GRID

**Note** <br>
Flexbox and grid were designed so they would work amazingly together, and using flexbox items inside of your grid containers is one of the best ways to lay out a site

<hr>

Flexbox is one dimension
Grid is two dimension

See it grid more like a tetris

Apparently this two properties are obsolete

```css
grid-row-gap: 20px;
grid-column-gap: 10px;
```

Use instead the new one

```css
row-gap: 20px;
column-gap: 10px;
```
