# FLEXBOX

CSS3 layout mode that provides an easy and clean way to arrange items within a container

- Bye bye floats
- Responsive
- Positioning child elements easier
- Flex container's margins do not collapse with the margins of its contents
- Order of elements can easily be changed without editing source HTML
- Built for small scale layouts, with "grid" is for large scale layouts. (We can use both!)
- align-agnostic, block element is horizontal biased
