# RxJS

Observer pattern source -> subscribe -> observer

Library for reactive programming using observables.

Observable 8:50
Data (can emit multiple data) 9:00
Operator 11:30
Pipe 12:00
Observer 12:55

## Observer

## Pipes

## Operators

A ton of operators lmao and documentation. The first one is easy, simple, direct to the point to RxJs

This solve my issue in the `webpack.config.js`

```json
devServer: {
    static: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, './'),
      watch: true,
    },
  },

```

### Observables

There are hot and cold observables.
It is in java but the theory I think it can be language agnostic

## NPM

Managing different versions of node (super useful).
`sudo n`

Command to change the location for global modules and getting the location
1- `npm config set prefix /Users/dev/npm_basics/globalnodemodules`
2-`npm config get prefix`

See in terminal all the info of the dependency
`npm view lodash`

Removing a module
`npm remove <name>` or `npm unistall <name>`

> Installing a global module is a bad practice, however if it is a CLI that's fine.

Sometimes we could have problems with the dependencies and maybe something happen with the cache. <br>
**However** npm has a good self-heal cache from corruption.<br>
You could delete the cache with `npm cache clean` although npm will throw you a warning about doing this practice, which is not recommend. <br>
If you feel confident well add the flag force to make it happen. `npm cache clean --force`

If you don't what you're doing, don't worry use this command to verify the files. `npm cache verify`

### Dev dependencies

This will only installed the modules for production environment. NOT development
`NODE_ENV="production" npm install`

### Peer dependencies

You will mostly use it when creating a dependency. Also when a module need another one, like react-dom it needs react.

### Creating custom scripts

Because this is custom script and NPM doesn't have the command.
To run a custom script `npm run <custom-script>`

Add this snippet in package.json `"custom_script": "echo 'This is a custom script'"`

### Npx

A package can be executable without installing the package. It is an npm package runner so if any packages arenâ€™t already installed it will install them automatically.
We only use once this `npx create-react-app myApp`. (I don't know any other examples)
